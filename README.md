## Description:
This project involved cleaning up the HTML & CSS for the homepage of a digital marketing agency called Horiseon. The refactoring project involved a few different adjacent goals - improving the accessibility of the website, cleaning up the CSS, and improving the SEO of the page.
Improving the accessibility means making sure it adheres to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). The purpose of these guidelines is to make sure the internet is useable to anyone regardless of disability. For example the site needs to function for people using a screen-reader, or for people who need to increase font size in order to read it.
Cleaning up the CSS in this case involved consolidating .classes and reordering them so that they match the flow of semantic tags in the .html document.
Improving the accessibility also improves the SEO of the page - for example, by using HTML5 layout elements and including alt text for images.
